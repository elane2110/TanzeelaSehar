                    Hello Humans! I hope you have been found by my page in good health and wealth. Lets know a bit more about me!!!!!

                    <h4>2019-2020</h4>
                
                    I started my CS journey with my CS degree, before then, I only had a vague idea about the field which for sure
                    wasnt much helpful for a beginner like me. For the first two years of my degree, I was just making sure to grab the 
                    coding concepts I was being taught. I liked to code but never tried to work on any application.
                    <br>
                    I built strong understanding of concepts like <span>Data Structures and Algorithms, Database Management Systems</span> and 
                    <span>Object Oriented Programming</span>, and languages like <span>C#/C</span> and <span>Java</span>. Wanted to learn <span>Python</span>
                    , but it was too simple for my mind to understand. 
                </p>
                <p class="body-datascience">
                    <h4>2021</h4>
                    
                    My real understanding about CS started from, when I was in my third year of College. I got the opportunity to 
                    complete a 6-month long course on <span>Big Data Analytics</span>, from a prestigious insititute of Pakistan, for free!
                    From there, I got introduced to the fascinating world of <span>Machine Learning</span>, a cutting-edge field that completely captivated me
                    (and also I got the chance to become familiar with Python!).
                    <br>
                    Well then, I worked on multiple <span>Datascience</span> projects, as in, trained multiple <span>predictive models</span>
                    using ML models like <span>(linear and logistic)regression, Decision Trees, K-means, KNN </span>etc. I used to enjoy, applying 
                    my <span>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</span> skills on the given dataset, to find valuable insights from the data, and to
                    see the insightful visualizations using <span>Matplotlib</span> and <span>Seaborn</span>. I got to learn about the fine use of <span>pandas</span>, 
                    the Python library ofcourse, and also <span>numpy</span>. I learned how to use <span>SQL</span> for storing data, and to use queries to get the desired batch of data!
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p class="final-year">
                    <h4>2022</h4>
                    
                    By this time, I had the idea of which field I wanted to pursue my career in. You guessed it right? Yeah <span>Artificial Intelligence</span>
                    it is! But it is a very broad field, very quickly growing, one gets overwhelmed sometimes, and might feel lost as well. <br>
                    Now was the time when I had to choose my Final-Year-Project-I. I thought for days and then I came forward with an idea. The project was named
                    <span><i>Stray Dogs Drone Detection System</i></span>. The idea was to create a <span>Deep Learning model</span> which uses <span>object detection</span> to detect the dogs in 
                    real time, and then the API would send the notification to the application, the notification would state the location of the dog. And the 
                    relevant organization would take the dog for vaccination and sterilization purposes. But guess what, I only managed to create the DL model, then later realized
                    that the idea wasnt very much cost friendly, and would work better with cameras integrated with that dog-detection model. 
                    <br>
                    Now I was in my final semester, and was supposed to come up with another idea for my Final-Year-Project-II. After submitting the project I would've
                    graduated by 2023 but things didnt go well and I ended up not submitting anything, hence will now submit the project next year i.e. in 2024! 
                </p>
                <p class="2023">
                    <h4>2023</h4>
                    I started the year by enrolling in the <span><a href="https://coursera.org/share/71084a05f80c15cd8d7ec1d3b3c46fc0" target="_blank">Google Data
                     Analytics specialization</a></span>, a <span><a href="https://grow.google/intl/en_pk/certificates/" target="_blank">Grow With Google</a></span> program,
                    sponsored to me by <span><a href="https://www.irm.edu.pk/index.php/about-irm/" target="_blank">IRM</a></span>, a Pakistani organization.
                    In Feb, I did some freelancing on Upwork, as a feedback provider, for AI based research articles, made $40! A nice achievement it was.
                    <br>
                    While completing the specialization, I started to work on my skills, hence decided to do some projects! Started with a <span>mental-health chatbot</span>, which 
                    is a <span>Natural Language Processing(NLP)</span> based project. It was working but wasnt working great, me being a perfectionist (or atleast we pretend so!), so I decided
                    to take a break from AI related stuff. 
                    <br>
                    Since I never worked on creating any application or a website, I never feel much of a "Software Engineer" and so the Imposter Syndrome
                    caught me! Now was the time to deal with it. I decided to work on a few web-dev related projects, starting from following some tutorials.
                    First of all, I created a portfolio website and left it incomplete, then created a one-page Netflix Clone, and then was creating a card-game but 
                    lost interest because now again, I wanted to do something new!
                    <br>
                    Decided to create an <span>API</span> for my dog-detection model! Im still working on it tho. I wanted to get some remote work, so I took a break from the 
                    API project to create this very <span>portfolio</span> you are reading right now!
                    For now, this is it! Will also add a <span>Blog</span> section here, once Im done with my previously left incompleted projects!
                    Thanks for being here! Have a great day!
